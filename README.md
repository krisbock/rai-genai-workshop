# Responsible AI for Generative AI Workshop

Welcome to the Responsible AI for Generative AI Workshop! This workshop is designed to demonstrate the different tooling and techniques available that enable you to build generative AI applications in Azure responsibly.  Each tutorial is designed to build up the previous one, so it is recommended to go through them in order.

### reference to HARMS and mitigations.

One of the approaches that we can use, to determine if our tools and techniques are effective, is to evaluate the impact of the mitigations on the model's performance.  The necessitates the use of datasets and both mathematical based metrics and AI-assisted metrics to quantitatively measure the generative AI application performance.

Preqrequisites:

Follow the instructions in [0-prerequisites](./0-prerequisites/README.md) to prepare your environment .


## Tutorials

### Tutorial 1: Model and Mitigations
In this tutorial, we will focus on understanding the models used in generative AI and explore various mitigation techniques to ensure responsible and ethical AI practices.

### Tutorial 2: Safety Systems (Azure Content Safety)
The second tutorial will cover safety systems, specifically Azure Content Safety. We will learn how to leverage this platform to enhance the safety and security of generative AI models.

### Tutorial 3: Metaprompt and Grounding
In the third tutorial, we will dive into metaprompt and grounding techniques. These techniques play a crucial role in ensuring the reliability and interpretability of generative AI models.

### Tutorial 4: User Experience
The fourth and final tutorial will explore user experience considerations when working with generative AI models. We will discuss best practices and strategies to create a seamless and user-friendly experience.

## Layers of Mitigations

Throughout the workshop, we will explore different layers of mitigations for responsible AI in generative AI use cases.

1. Platform-level Mitigations:
   - Tutorial 1 and Tutorial 2 focus on the platform-level mitigations, which involve understanding the models, implementing mitigations, and leveraging safety systems like Azure Content Safety.

2. Application-level Mitigations:
   - Tutorial 3 and Tutorial 4 cover application-level mitigations, which include metaprompt and grounding techniques, as well as considerations for user experience.

We hope this workshop provides valuable insights and practical knowledge to ensure responsible and ethical use of generative AI. Happy learning!

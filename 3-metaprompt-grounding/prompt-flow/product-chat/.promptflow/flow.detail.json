It builds upon existing transformer-based text representations and applies smoothness inducing technology and Noise Contrastive Estimation for improved robustness and faster training[doc1]. DTE also offers pretrained models for in-context learning, which can be used to find semantically similar natural language utterances[doc2]. These models can be further finetuned for specific tasks, such as prompt crafting, to enhance the performance of downstream inference models like GPT-3[doc2][doc3][doc4].

It builds upon existing transformer-based text representations and applies smoothness inducing technology and Noise Contrastive Estimation for improved robustness and faster training[doc1]. DTE also offers pretrained models for in-context learning, which can be used to find semantically similar natural language utterances[doc2]. These models can be further finetuned for specific tasks, such as prompt crafting, to enhance the performance of downstream inference models like GPT-3[doc2][doc3][doc4]. However, this finetuning may require a significant amount of data[doc3][doc4].\n\nsystem:\nYou are an AI assistant that helps people find information.\n\nconversation:\n{{ conversation }}\n\nuser:\n## Retrieved Documents\n{{ documentation }}\n\n## User Question\n{{user_query}}\n",

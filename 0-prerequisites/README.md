# Prerequisites

For this tutorial, we will be using the Azure AI SDK (which is currently in preview).  Follow the instructions in the link below to install the SDK.  You can either install the SDK into an existing development environment, or run it via an internet browser or Docker container by using VS Code (web) in Azure AI Studio, Visual Studio Code Dev Container, or GitHub Codespaces.
